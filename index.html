							Starting with the topic of the day. I will exaplin you What is the Drupal Console?
						</p>
						<p>
							The Drupal Console is a suite of tools that you run on the (CLI) to generate boilerplate code and interact with a Drupal 8 installation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yes I know this sounds like a tool you already know, and it's called drush.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are similitudes and differences, that I will show ypu during this presentation.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>But ... I want to clarify one important point:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Drupal Console is not a Drupal Module.</li>
							<li>Drupal Console is a Symfony Application.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The DrupalConsole application takes advantage of Symfony Console Component and other third party libraries.
						</p>
						<p>
							DrupalConsole has been built to utilize the same modern PHP practices which were introduced in Drupal 8.

						<h3>@omers</h3>
						<p>
							Drupal 8 is more technically advanced compared to its predecessor and managing the increasing complexity of Drupal 8 could be a daunting task for anyone. Drupal Console is a suite of tools to help manage that complexity. Writing a Drupal 8 module now involves a lot more boilerplate code and there is a lot you need to know and do just to get started building a new module. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I will list some differences between Drupal 8 and 7, related to writing a module.
						</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Drupal 8 is object oriented and Drupal 7 is mostly procedural.</li>
								<li>Each class will need a namespace and must be created within and specific directory.</li>
								<li>Each class must include other classes defined within a namespace.</li>
								<li>Each class could extend or implement another classes.</li>
								<li>Drupal 8 takes advantage of external libraries.</li>
								<li>Drupal 8 uses .yml files for configuration.</li>
								<li>Drupal 8 uses plugins which provide reusable pieces of functionality.</li>
								<li>Drupal 8 uses PHP annotations. The Drupal 8 plugin system uses them to describe plugins and they are used by Drupal to discover your plugin.</li>
							</ul>

					<h1 class="medium white">How does Drupal Console help?</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
								The main goal of DrupalConsole is, to help you developing faster and smarter with Drupal 8.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
								Drupal Console provides a number of commands for creating module scaffolding and boilerplate code. For each command, you will be asked a series of questions about what you want to generate.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
								Drupal Console allows you to interact with your Drupal installation from rebulding cache, installing modules, debugging the syustem to configuration management.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
								You can even learn Drupal 8, inspecting the generated comment blocks while using --learning option. (similar to examples module)

			<h2>Using the Installer</h2>
			<hr/>
<p>
Install the Console locally by running the installer <br/> in your project directory:
</p>
<br/>
<pre><code class="bash text-medium">
$ curl http://drupalconsole.com/installer | php

$ mv console.phar /usr/local/bin/drupal

$ drupal

</code></pre>
		<aside class="notes">
			<h3>jmolivas</h3>
			<p>
				There are different ways to get the project on your local machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				My recomendation, for getting the project on your local machine is by using the installer.
			</p>
		</aside>
		</section>

		<section>	
			<img class="no-border" src="assets/images/console-installer.png" alt="">
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>
					You can install the Drupal Console locally by running the installer in your project directory, the installer will take care of downloading the necesary files to run drupal console on you computer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The installer script will simply check some php.ini settings, warn you if they are set incorrectly, and then download the latest console.phar in the current directory.
				</p>
<!-- 				<p>
					You can place this file anywhere you wish. If you put it in your PATH, you can access it globally. On unixy systems you can even make it executable and invoke it without php.
				</p> -->
				<p>
					You can use it as local file by typing php console.phar

				</p>
				<p>
					But if want to access DrupalConsole from anywhere on your system, you need to move to a global accesible path.
				</p>
				<p>
					NOTE: In this example I am moving the executable phar file to "/usr/local/bin/drupal". 
					<br/>
					The name drupal is just an alias you can name it anything you like.

The need for it became clear when we were executing commands like "generate:controller" and needed to execute another command by hand such as "router:rebuild" to rebuild the routing system.

The initial idea was to chain command execution within commands.

<p>
When that functionality was completed I had a discussion with the other project maintainers and we came up with the idea to create a command that could read a configuration file containing a queue and execute several commands based on the sequence defined in the configuration file.	
</p>
<p>
	We decide to use a standard YAML file extension and not go with something like chain extension because we did not want to add a new Drupalism to the project.
</p>
<p>
<h3>How this command can help you?</h3>
You can create your own chain command and define the common Drupal 8 features you use while writing a Drupal 8 module and execute one command to have those features generated, as example:

				<p>
					I spend almost two days working with Greg Anderson at Pantheon offices and we made the DrupalConsole bootstrap and it has been improved further since then. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We provide an integration and now drush can register DrupalConsole commands, and you can execute a DrupalConsole command using a drush alias.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're going to be sprinting at BADCamp; anyone who wants to pitch in is welcome to join us.

				<h3>jmolivas</h3>
				<p>
					We really want to make the tool even more accessible to all site administrators of Drupal 8.
				</p>
				<p>
					Adding a GUI for Drupal Console as an alternative to the CLI.
				</p>
				<p>
					This could be especially useful for site builders wanting to take advante of this tool without needing to use the command line.
				</p>
				<p>
					It could be used for code generation in the form of a downloadable compressed file.
